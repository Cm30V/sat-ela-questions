The exact acoustic properties that give a song swing, however,\nhave long been thought to be undeﬁnable. To investigate swing, a team led by physicist Corentin Nelias delayed the\n\ndownbeats and synchronized the offbeats in jazz piano solos and asked jazz musicians to compare the intensity of swing in\neach modiﬁed piece with the intensity of swing in the original piece. They found that participants were more than seven\n\ntimes likelier to characterize the modiﬁed songs as having swing than to characterize the original versions as having swing,\nsuggesting that ______",

In the 1970s, American painter Jack Whitten\nbuilt a 12-foot (3.7-meter) tool he named the “developer” to apply paint to an entire canvas in one motion, resulting in his\n\nseries of “slab” paintings from that decade. Whitten described this process as making an entire painting in “one gesture,”\n\nsignaling a clear departure from the prevalence of gestures in his work from the 1960s. Some art historians claim this shift\nrepresents “removing gesture” from the process. Therefore, regardless of whether using the developer constitutes a gesture,\n\nboth Whitten and these art historians likely agree that ______",

Researchers Jenna Ekwealor and Kirsten M. Fisher found several species of Syntrichia\ncaninervis, a type of desert moss, growing under quartz crystals in California’s Mojave Desert. To evaluate whether these\n\nsemitransparent rocks beneﬁted the moss, the researchers compared the shoot tissue, a measure of plant growth, of S.\n\ncaninervis when growing on the soil surface versus when the moss was growing under the quartz rocks. They found that the\nshoot tissue was 62% longer for moss growing under the quartz as compared to moss on the soil surface, suggesting that\n\n______",

Instead, it is precisely his exposure to lighting techniques at\nthe time that contributed to his theory on the importance of light.

This experience developed his\n\nunderstanding of what was possible in the coordination of elements on the stage.\n\nBased on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the claim about Appia’s level of technical expertise\nmade by Bremner in Text 1?",
